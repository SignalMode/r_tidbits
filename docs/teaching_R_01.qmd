## Why R?

::: {.incremental}

1. Reproducible
2. Directions that can be shared and followed precisely
2. Tools for repeated tasks/reporting
3. Functions for manipulating data
4. Project organization/Data management
5. Maps & Spatial Fun!
6. Visualizing data
7. General sanity

## R Benefits

- It's open source and community resources galore
- it's **reproducible** for others (and your future self!)
- easy to re-use, recycle skills you've used elsewhere

## What we need today

 - R language (software): The Engine
 - RStudio (software): The Steering Wheel

## Navigating Code

 - Packages (like apps on your phone)
    - contain *`functions()`*
        - which contain *`arguments=`*
        
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

read.csv(file = ,
         header = ,
         skip = , 
         stringsAsFactors = 
        )


readr::read_csv(file = ,
         col_names = ,
         show_col_types = ,
         skip = , 
         stringsAsFactors = 
        )


```

## Important Bits

**`<-`** save this temporarily in **Environment** tab (`Alt + -`)

**` |> `** (or **` %>% `**) the pipe, read as "and then" (`Ctrl + Shift + m`)

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

data_i_want <- read_csv(file = "my_super_data.csv")

data_i_want_filtered <- data_i_want |> 
  dplyr::filter(variable > 3)

```

## Important Basics

`{dplyr}` package has so much! These are the main ones to consider:

`filter` keeps or discards **rows** (aka observations)

`select` keeps or discards **columns** (aka variables)

`arrange` sorts data set by certain variables

`count` tallies data set by certain variables

`mutate` creates new variables

`group_by`/`summarize` aggregates data (pivot tables!)



## Spreadsheets!

## Fun Activity 
**Joint Activity**:

 - Pair up
 - Someone volunteer to open any spreadsheet on your computer so you both can view
 - **Without actually editing it** see what things you could do to make it tidy!?
 - Make a list so we can see what are really common "untidy" things
 - [fun art](https://allisonhorst.com/everything-else)
