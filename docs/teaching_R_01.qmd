## Why R?

::: {.incremental}

1. Reproducible
2. Directions that can be shared
2. Tools for repeated tasks/reporting
3. Functions for manipulating data
4. Project organization/Data management
5. Maps and more data manipulation
6. Visualizing data

## R Benefits

- You don't have to use Excel
- It's open source and community resources galore
- it's **reproducible** for others (and your future self!)
- easy to re-use, recycle skills you've used elsewhere

## What we need today

 - R language (software): The Engine
 - RStudio (software): The Steering Wheel
 
## Navigating RStudio

## Navigating Code

 - Packages (libraries of code)
    - contain *functions*
        - which contain *verbs*

## Important Bits

**`<-`** 
  
- save this temporarily for use later, in **Environment** tab (`Alt + -`)

**` |> `** or **` %>% `** 

 - "and then" (`Ctrl + Shift + m`)

## Important Basics

`filter` keeps or discards **rows** (aka observations)

`select` keeps or discards **columns** (aka variables)

`arrange` sorts data set by certain variables

`count` tallies data set by certain variables

`mutate` creates new variables

`group_by`/`summarize` aggregates data (pivot tables!)
